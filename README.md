# Detect Spam Messages - Natural Languague Processing

[**View Notebook**](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/detect-spam-messages-nlp/blob/master/detect-spam-sms-nlp.ipynb)

In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a form that machine learning algorithms can understand. Next I train a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I will classify unlabel messages into normal or spam.

### Dataset Informatiom

The [SMS Spam Collection Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection) is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.
